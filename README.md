              open source python libraries for building conversational
              software. Their purpose is to make machine-learning based
              dialogue management and language understanding accessible to
              non-specialist software developers. In terms of design
              philosophy, we aim for ease of use, and bootstrapping from
              minimal (or no) initial training data. Both packages are
              extensively documented and ship with a comprehensive suite of
              tests. The code is available at https://github.com/RasaHQ/",
